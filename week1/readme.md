## Convolutional Neural Networks
### Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks

Learn to implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and 
to stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image 
classification problems.

##### Learning Objectives
Understand the convolution operation
Understand the pooling operation
Remember the vocabulary used in convolutional neural network (padding, stride, 
filter, ...)
Build a convolutional neural network for image multi-class classification
